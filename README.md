# UFOs
## Overview
Using HTML and Javascript I created a dynamic webpage that holds data from UFO sightings and accepts user input to filter the search criteria. Our dataset included all elements of UFO sightings including **Date,  City,  State,  Country,  Shape,  Duration,  and Comments.**
## Results
Users can access the website and filter the search criteria as follows:
### Filter by Date

### Filter by City

## Summary

One Drawback to this design is that the user needs to be familiar with the data in the table in order to know which search criteria to use to filter. Some possible solutions to this would be to include a drop-down menu that includes all possible values for that particular field, so the user can select which one they want to filter by. Additionally, the data is very limited so it would be good to add more data that is more recent so users can explore more relevant data.
